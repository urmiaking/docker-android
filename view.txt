1- First run the emulator from docker-compose with the specified volume (From scratch)
2- After the device booted, user may have make some modifcations to os for example installing an application
3- When Container stops, we have to copy userdata-img userdata-qemu.img and userdata-qemu.img.qcow2 file to a directory in the host machine for that specific Container
4- Also delete the hardware-qemu.ini.lock and multiinstance.lock "rm /home/androidusr/emulator/*.lock" in the volume.
5- There should be a backup folder in the Container which mounted to user's backup folder in the host machine.
6- In the second run, we should copy the backup folder into emulator folder.
7- Run the emulator!

* each time container stops, we should backup those 3 files from emulator folder into backup folder which is mounted to backup directory of host machine
  considering this, We shall have no need to mount the entire emulator folder!
